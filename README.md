# Case: RobCo
Cloud application tech case challenge for RobCo.

## Instructions

### Requirements
1. [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) v3.13
2. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) v2.1 (Python package and dependency manager)
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_VERSION=2.1.3 python3 -
# Follow the install instructions and add Poetry to PATH if required. Verify that Poetry works:
poetry --help
```
3. [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) (Just a command runner. Inspired by _make_)
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin
# just should now be executable. If not: export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin". Verify that just works:
just --help
```
4. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) v24.0.6
5. [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start) v1.36

_These are suggested installations; adapt paths to suit your local environment._

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `just setup-env` to create the development environment and install dependencies. This should provision the minikube cluster and the deployments running there, or should this be in another command?


    Clone the repository.
    Run just setup-env to create the development environment and install dependencies. This will also create a .env file in the root directory.
    Adjust environment variables in .env, if necessary.
    Run just to see available commands and options, including how to start the FastAPI server for local development.
    Run just run-server to launch the application, and verify itâ€™s working by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
    The endpoints are secured using basic authentication.
        The default username is username and the password is password.
        The credentials can be adjusted in the .env file.

Quality Assurance
For quality assurance, a couple of tools are set up already. To install pre-commit run just pc i. To run pre-commit hooks for all files use just pc a.

### Contributing
Test locally, then commit. Pre-commit tests are run locally.

## Notes

### Assumptions & Tradeoffs
- todo:)

## TODO
- [x] Deploy minikube k8s cluster
- [ ] Test deploy a new namespace with a deployment+pod+svc (dummy image) for the BE+FE
- [ ] Test build my own Docker image for the BE
- [ ] Deploy simple python FastAPI BE
- [ ] Deploy simple (Framework: React) FE (web UI)
- [ ] Test initial setup
- [ ] Setup some svc/ingress to locally access the BE & FE
- [ ] Deploy Loki
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus
- [ ] Write local setup instructions
- [ ] Add architecture overview diagrams (drawio)
- [ ] Add notes on assumptions and tradeoffs

Q: how to manage the deployments to minikube? Terraform(not so infra heavy project apart from the minikube cluster itself..), ArgoCD?

### Improvements
- [ ] Manage minikube k8s cluster creation and destruction with terraform?
- [ ] Add pre-commit
- [ ] Automate with GHA
- [ ] Use OTEL? Standards for logs and metrics, then the logs/metrics backends can be changed later.
